How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	By seeing what changed between them.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Comparing older versions and seeing more easily what changed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Having versions that always make sense and always compile

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because code can "speak" to other files while those others can't really.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows us the commit history and git diff allows us to see
what changed between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always go back if something happens

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
